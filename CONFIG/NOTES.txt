For each instrument the config file contains a date under the astroquery block.

This date is to be used for generating a list of equally spaced date intervals,
which in turn will be used to programmatically search for 1 month chunks of darks.

There is no efficient way to do this in a generalized manner without querying
for every dark taken and then using the date of the very first dark as the start
date.
